# Project Outcomes & Conclusions


Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:


        1.  The Dataset was large enough summing around 5.4 lakh samples & we used a 10k subsamples for creation of the model.
        
        2.  For the segmentation we used RMF Technique to create working table as it is most common segmentation technique.
        
        3.  Visualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the relationship between the feature-set.
        
        4.  Appropriate Transformations were applied on the data to satisfy the key assumptions. Followed by Standardization.
        
        5.  K Means algorithm was applied and appropriate cluster number was selected using Elbow Plot.
        
        6.  The results were interepreted by calculating the cluster means & it was visualised with help of snake plot.
